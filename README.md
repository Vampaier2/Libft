# Libft

I have 2 **Libft** folders, because one of them `Libft` is true to the source code, 
while the other `Libft_protected` is an **upgraded** version of the original Libft,
protecting some leaks that the original functions may have.

| Libft_protected|     🚧     |      ✅     |     🚧     |

✅ - Accepted

❌ - Not allowed/might have errors

🚧 - **Might** complain because it isn't true to the source functions
